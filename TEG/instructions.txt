Simple easy instructions :)

To add artwork images:
 - Run the program called 'open-image-folder'.
 - Put images there.

To add a standalone artwork page:
 - Run the program called 'edit-artworks'.
 - Copy the existing format to add a new artwork with a title, description and
   name of the image file you added in the images folder (must include the
   image type, e.g. 'image.png', 'image.jpg', 'image.jpeg'...).
 - Save the file.

To add a new album or edit an existing album:
 - Run the program called 'edit-albums'.
 - Copy the existing format to set the album title and description.
 - Copy the existing format to add new artworks to the album (as above).
 - Save the file.

To preview your changes and pick up other changes:
 - Run the program called 'preview' (leave the command window open while you
   view the page).
 - If the browser page that opens says "Unable to load", just refresh the page
   and it should work.
 - If you make further changes you should see them automatically when you
   refresh the page, as long as the 'preview' program window is still open.

To release your changes:
 - Run the program called 'release'.
 - When it says "Done!" you can close the window.
 - See your changes at http://lewisgaul.github.io/artwork-site (may take a
   minute to update).

If something doesn't seem right:
 - Run the program called 'debug', and send me the log file that is created
   called 'debug-log'.
